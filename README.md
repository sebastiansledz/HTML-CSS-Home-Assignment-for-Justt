# HTML/CSS Home assignment

## A note for reviewers

I am happy to share my outcome and few thoughts about it for your better understanding of my choices.

You may find the site in the html folder.

At first, the repository contains 4 commits: initial, 3h commit, 4h commit and the last one with that readme file.

When review the 3h commit, accordingly to its name, you will be able to see how the code looks after 3h of works.

The 4h commit adds missing assets, changes within footer and some minor tweaks.

For the site structure I was using a flexbox model. I think this is the quickest way to achieve basic responsiveness from the very beginning and save some time for other improvements.

There is no JS magic except one thing that helps to get rid of the browser default tooltip for required input fields and allows to place own validation message below the input field.

For the active state of arrow icon, I think I've not mastered enough the SVG filter on it to get the exact same on hover effect as on your design but I tied to be as close as possible. If there is a cleaner way to achieve it, I am open to learn it :)

I am happy to answer any questions regarding the assignment on a call.
